# Backtrader-GoldenCross-vs-Buy&Hold
Using Backtrader to test a simple buy-and-hold vs the "golden cross" trading strategy. Done using SPY stock data imported from finance.

The "golden cross" indicator is a bullish trading signal that forms when a shorter-term moving average crosses over a longer-term moving average. Typically seen when the 50-day moving average crosses over the 200-day moving average of an underlying asset. 

The "death cross" indicator is a bearish indicator that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, reversing the "golden cross".

The "golden cross" strategy uses the "golden cross" and "death cross" as buy and sell indicators, respectively.
